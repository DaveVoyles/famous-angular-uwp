Turn a famous + angular web application into a Windows 10 UWP App
----------
### Objective

- *[Download the finished version of this tutorial. Open with Visual Studio](https://github.com/DaveVoyles/Famous-Angular-Pokemon-Cordova)*
- *[View the project in your browser](http://famous-angular-pokemon.azurewebsites.net/app/#/)*
- *[Tutorial for the web portion of the project](https://github.com/DaveVoyles/famous-angular-Pokemon/blob/master/README.md)*

I love high performance JavaScript, and have faith that others will finally come around and understand its true potential someday too. Famo.us allows you to maintain a silky smooth 60 Frames Per Second while having fluid animations on screen. Famo.us does this by utilizing the CSS3 primitive -webkit-transform: matrix3d, which lets the framework compute the composite matrix and skip the browser’s renderer. No plug-in, no download, no hack. By appending this to each DIV, developers can render the composite matrix and go straight to the GPU. Even better, we can have this running on mobile devices.

I go more in depth when discussing the ins-and-outs of Famo.us in an [earlier blog post.](http://www.davevoyles.com/creating-a-mobile-app-with-famo-us-and-manifoldjs/) 

### By the end of this project you will be able to:

- Understand how to turn a web application into a hybrid Windows 10 application that takes advantage of the Universal Windows Platform.

My goal for this project to illustrate how easily you can create HTML5 / JS projects which work at near native speeds on mobile / desktop applications. 


### Requirements
- [Visual Studio 2015 or 2013](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/downloads/visual-studio-2015-downloads-vs.aspx)

### Conclusion
That's all there is to it. You have a fully functioning HTML5 app for the Windows 10 UWP. You can read more about our Hosted Web App platform, [Project Westminster](http://www.davevoyles.com/project-westminster-hosted-web-apps-for-uwp-html5-in-win-10/), which also illustrates how to communicate to the native features of a Windows 10 app.
