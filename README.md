Turn a famous + angular web application into a Windows 10 UWP App
----------
### Objective

- *[Download the finished version of this tutorial. Open with Visual Studio](https://github.com/DaveVoyles/Famous-Angular-Pokemon-Cordova)*
- *[View the project in your browser](http://famous-angular-pokemon.azurewebsites.net/app/#/)*
- *[Tutorial for the web portion of the project](https://github.com/DaveVoyles/famous-angular-Pokemon/blob/master/README.md)*

I love high performance JavaScript, and have faith that others will finally come around and understand its true potential someday too. Famo.us allows you to maintain a silky smooth 60 Frames Per Second while having fluid animations on screen. Famo.us does this by utilizing the CSS3 primitive -webkit-transform: matrix3d, which lets the framework compute the composite matrix and skip the browserâ€™s renderer. No plug-in, no download, no hack. By appending this to each DIV, developers can render the composite matrix and go straight to the GPU. Even better, we can have this running on mobile devices.

I go more in depth when discussing the ins-and-outs of Famo.us in an [earlier blog post.](http://www.davevoyles.com/creating-a-mobile-app-with-famo-us-and-manifoldjs/) 

### By the end of this project you will be able to:

- Understand how to turn a web application into a hybrid Windows 10 application that takes advantage of the Universal Windows Platform.

My goal for this project to illustrate how easily you can create HTML5 / JS projects which work at near native speeds on mobile / desktop applications. 


### Requirements
- [Visual Studio 2015 or 2013](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/downloads/visual-studio-2015-downloads-vs.aspx) 
- [Windows 10 SDK (Included with Visual Studio).](https://dev.windows.com/en-us/downloads/windows-10-developer-tools)
- [Visual Studio Tools for Cordova](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn771545.aspx)


### Setup
 1.  Download the source from [GitHub](https://github.com/DaveVoyles/Famous-Angular-Pokemon-Cordova)
 3.  Install [Visual Studio 2015 or 2013](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/downloads/visual-studio-2015-downloads-vs.aspx) 
 3.  Install [Windows 10 SDK (Included with Visual Studio).](https://dev.windows.com/en-us/downloads/windows-10-developer-tools)
 4.  Install - [Visual Studio Tools for Cordova](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn771545.aspx) 
 
 **NOTE:** You can find the project this is based off of (just the web stuff) [here.](https://github.com/DaveVoyles/famous-angular-Pokemon)

### Create a wrapper folder called "App" in the root directory
The purpose of this folder is to contain everything that we are about to insert from our website into this UWP project. It also allows us to add the two **bower_components** folders without conflicting. In our website, one **bower_components** folder is in the root directory, and the other is contained within our app folder.

Afterwards, lace css, images, and JS content in the app folder

### Updating package.appxmanifest

The appxmanifest is an XML document which contains properties for our application, such as the UI, capabilities, and packaging. 



### Conclusion
That's all there is to it. You have a fully functioning HTML5 app for the Windows 10 UWP. You can read more about our Hosted Web App platform, [Project Westminster](http://www.davevoyles.com/project-westminster-hosted-web-apps-for-uwp-html5-in-win-10/), which also illustrates how to communicate to the native features of a Windows 10 app.
